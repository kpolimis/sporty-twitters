This paper describes the construction of a large, multilingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigates statistical models for determining the gender of uncharacterized Twitter users. We explore several different classifier types on this dataset. We show the degree to which classifier accuracy varies based on tweet volumes as well as when various kinds of profile metadata are included in the models. We also perform a large-scale human assessment using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our methods significantly out-perform both baseline models and almost all humans on the same task.},

    The task of learning to partition data into similar sets occurs
    frequently in many disciplines.  We construct a Bayesian model for
    learning to partition from labeled data.  Our model is based on the
    nonparametric Dirichlet process prior.  Experimental results show that
    our model is able to outperform existing solutions on real world
    datasets.

In this study, we measured the Big Five personality traits of 142 participants and collected their tweets over a 1-month period. Extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism were associated with specific linguistic markers, suggesting that personality manifests in microblogs. Meanwhile, eight observers rated the participants’ personality on the basis of their tweets. Results showed that observers relied on specific linguistic cues when making judgments, and could only judge agreeableness and neuroticism accurately. This study provides new empirical evidence of personality expression in naturalistic settings, and points to the potential of utilizing social media for personality research.},

	abstract = {Objective: To review systematically prospective, observational, cohort studies of the association between positive well-being and mortality using meta-analytic methods. Recent years have witnessed increased interest in the relationship between positive psychological well-being and physical health.
Methods: We searched general bibliographic databases: Medline, {PsycINFO}, Web of Science, and {PubMed} up to January 2008. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations.
Results: There were 35 studies (26 articles) investigating mortality in initially healthy populations and 35 studies (28 articles) of disease populations. The meta-analyses showed that positive psychological well-being was associated with reduced mortality in both the healthy population (combined hazard ratio ({HR)} = 0.82; 95\% Confidence Interval ({CI)} = 0.76–0.89; p {\textless} .001) and the disease population (combined {HR} = 0.98; {CI} = 0.95–1.00; p = .030) studies. There were indications of publication bias in this literature, although the fail-safe numbers were 2444 and 1397 for healthy and disease population studies, respectively. Intriguingly, meta-analysis of studies that controlled for negative affect showed that the protective effects of positive psychological well-being were independent of negative affect. Both positive affect (e.g., emotional well-being, positive mood, joy, happiness, vigor, energy) and positive trait-like dispositions (e.g., life satisfaction, hopefulness, optimism, sense of humor) were associated with reduced mortality in healthy population studies. Positive psychological well-being was significantly associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in healthy population studies, and with reduced death rates in patients with renal failure and with human immunodeficiency virus-infection.
Conclusions: The current review suggests that positive psychological well-being has a favorable effect on survival in both healthy and diseased populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract This research synthesis integrates findings from 150 experimental, ambulatory and longitudinal studies that tested the impact of well-being on objective health outcomes. Results demonstrated that well-being positively impacts health outcomes (r=0.14). Well-being was found to be positively related to short-term health outcomes (r=0.15), long-term health outcomes (r=0.11), and disease or symptom control (r=0.13). Results from the experimental studies demonstrated that inductions of well-being lead to healthy functioning, and inductions of ill-being lead to compromised health at similar magnitudes. Thus, the effect of subjective well-being on health is not solely due to ill-being having a detrimental impact on health, but also to well-being having a salutary impact on health. Additionally, the impact of well-being on improving health was stronger for immune system response and pain tolerance, whereas well-being was not significantly related to increases in cardiovascular and physiological reactivity. These findings point to potential biological pathways, such that well-being can directly bolster immune functioning and buffer the impact of stress.},

Existing methods mostly rely on expensive surveys of hospitals across the country, typically with lag times of one to two weeks for influenza reporting, and even longer for less common diseases. In response, there have been several recently proposed solutions to estimate a population's health from Internet activity, most notably Google's Flu Trends service, which correlates search term frequency with influenza statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC).} In this paper, we analyze messages posted on the micro-blogging site Twitter.com to determine if a similar correlation can be uncovered. We propose several methods to identify influenza-related messages and compare a number of regression models to correlate these messages with {CDC} statistics. Using over 500,000 messages spanning 10 weeks, we find that our best model achieves a correlation of .78 with {CDC} statistics by leveraging a document classifier to identify relevant messages.},

We propose the first multi-indicator method for determining (1) the location where a tweet was created as well as (2) the location of the user's residence. Our method is based on various weighted indicators, including the names of places that appear in the text message, dedicated location entries, and additional information from the user profile. An evaluation shows that our method is capable of locating 92\% of all tweets with a median accuracy of below 30km, as well as predicting the user's residence with a median accuracy of below 5.1km. With that level of accuracy, our approach significantly outperforms existing work.},

In this tutorial we show how social media analysis can be exploited for two important stages of e-{EI}, namely: (i) Early Outbreak Detection, and (ii) Outbreak Analysis and Control. We discuss techniques and methods for detecting health-related events from unstructured text and outline approaches, as well as the challenges faced in social media-based surveillance. In particular, we will show how using Twitter can help us to find early cases of an outbreak, as well as, understand the potential causes of contamination and spread from the perspective of the field practitioners.},

This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey ({NHAPS)}, a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States ({U.S.)} sponsored by the {U.S.} Environmental Protection Agency ({EPA).} The primary purpose of {NHAPS} was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. {NHAPS} was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument ({CATI)} to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 {EPA} regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. {NHAPS} respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the {U.S.} and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board ({CARB)} sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when {NHAPS} was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ({ETS)} in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to {ETS} was reported to take place in residential locations.},

Of the sample of 772 tweets, 83\% (n = 640) were primarily categorized as a general statement of dental pain, 22\% (n = 170) as an action taken or contemplated, and 15\% (n = 112) as describing an impact on daily activities. Among the actions taken or contemplated, 44\% (n = 74) reported seeing a dentist, 43\% (n = 73) took an analgesic or antibiotic medication, and 14\% (n = 24) actively sought advice from the Twitter community. Twitter users extensively share health information relating to dental pain, including actions taken to relieve pain and the impact of pain. This new medium may provide an opportunity for dental professionals to disseminate health information.},

By contrast, this paper focuses on fine-grained modeling of the spread of infectious diseases throughout a large real-world social network. Specifically, we study the roles that social ties and interactions between specific individuals play in the progress of a contagion. We focus on public Twitter data, where we find that for every health-related message there are more than 1,000 unrelated ones. This class imbalance makes classification particularly challenging. Nonetheless, we present a framework that accurately identifies sick individuals from the content of online communication. Evaluation on a sample of 2.5 million geo-tagged Twitter messages shows that social ties to infected, symptomatic people, as well as the intensity of recent co-location, sharply increase one's likelihood of contracting the illness in the near future. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model the interplay of social activity, human mobility, and the spread of infectious disease in a large real-world population. Furthermore, we provide the first quantifiable estimates of the characteristics of disease transmission on a large scale without active user participation---a step towards our ability to model and predict the emergence of global epidemics from day-to-day interpersonal interactions.},

	abstract = {Micro-blogging services have become indispensable communication tools for online users for disseminating breaking news, eyewitness accounts, individual expression, and protest groups. Recently, Twitter, along with other online social networking services such as Foursquare, Gowalla, Facebook and Yelp, have started supporting location services in their messages, either explicitly, by letting users choose their places, or implicitly, by enabling geo-tagging, which is to associate messages with latitudes and longitudes. This functionality allows researchers to address an exciting set of questions: 1) How is information created and shared across geographical locations, 2) How do spatial and linguistic characteristics of people vary across regions, and 3) How to model human mobility. Although many attempts have been made for tackling these problems, previous methods are either complicated to be implemented or oversimplified that cannot yield reasonable performance. It is a challenge task to discover topics and identify users' interests from these geo-tagged messages due to the sheer amount of data and diversity of language variations used on these location sharing services. In this paper we focus on Twitter and present an algorithm by modeling diversity in tweets based on topical diversity, geographical diversity, and an interest distribution of the user. Furthermore, we take the Markovian nature of a user's location into account. Our model exploits sparse factorial coding of the attributes, thus allowing us to deal with a large and diverse set of covariates efficiently. Our approach is vital for applications such as user profiling, content recommendation and topic tracking. We show high accuracy in location estimation based on our model. Moreover, the algorithm identifies interesting topics based on location and language.},

	abstract = {Machine learning for text classification is the cornerstone of document categorization, news filtering, document routing, and personalization. In text domains, effective feature selection is essential to make the learning task efficient and more accurate. This paper presents an empirical comparison of twelve feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain) evaluated on a benchmark of 229 text classification problem instances that were gathered from Reuters, {TREC}, {OHSUMED}, etc. The results are analyzed from multiple goal perspectives-accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall-since each is appropriate in different situations. The results reveal that a new feature selection metric we call {'Bi-Normal} Separation' ({BNS)}, outperformed the others by a substantial margin in most situations. This margin widened in tasks with high class skew, which is rampant in text classification problems and is particularly challenging for induction algorithms. A new evaluation methodology is offered that focuses on the needs of the data mining practitioner faced with a single dataset who seeks to choose one (or a pair of) metrics that are most likely to yield the best performance. From this perspective, {BNS} was the top single choice for all goals except precision, for which Information Gain yielded the best result most often. This analysis also revealed, for example, that Information Gain and Chi-Squared have correlated failures, and so they work poorly together. When choosing optimal pairs of metrics for each of the four performance goals, {BNS} is consistently a member of the pair---e.g., for greatest recall, the pair {BNS} + F1-measure yielded the best performance on the greatest number of tasks by a considerable margin.},

The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

Instead of relying on surveys, we apply scalable machine learning techniques to noisy data mined from online social media and infer the health state of any given person in an automated way. We show that the learned patterns can be subsequently leveraged in descriptive as well as predictive fine-grained models of human health. Using a unified statistical model, we quantify the impact of social status, exposure to pollution, interpersonal interactions, and other important lifestyle factors on one's health. Our model explains more than 54\% of the variance in people's health (as estimated from their online communication), and predicts the future health status of individuals with 91\% accuracy.

We believe that there is greater potential for this technique for dengue, as the incidence of this pathogen can vary by a factor of ten in some settings, making prediction all the more important in public health planning. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of Google search terms in predicting dengue incidence in Singapore and Bangkok, Thailand using several regression techniques. Incidence data were provided by the Singapore Ministry of Health and the Thailand Bureau of Epidemiology. We find our models predict incident cases well (correlation greater than 0.8) and periods of high incidence equally well ({AUC} greater than 0.95).

The model has been calibrated so that outcomes are consistent with the 1957/1958 Asian A({H2N2)} and 2009 pandemic A({H1N1)} influenza viruses. We present examples of how this model can be used to study the dynamics of influenza epidemics in the United States and simulate how to mitigate or delay them using pharmaceutical interventions and social distancing measures.

We estimated linear models, using searches with 1-10-week lead times as explanatory variables to predict the percentage of cultures positive for influenza and deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza in the United States.

	abstract = {Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.},

    The task of learning to partition data into similar sets occurs
    frequently in many disciplines.  We construct a Bayesian model for
    learning to partition from labeled data.  Our model is based on the
    nonparametric Dirichlet process prior.  Experimental results show that
    our model is able to outperform existing solutions on real world
    datasets.
